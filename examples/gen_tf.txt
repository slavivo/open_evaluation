A neural network is a machine learning program, or model, that makes decisions in a manner similar to the human brain, by using processes that mimic the way biological neurons work together to identify phenomena, weigh options and arrive at conclusions.

Every neural network consists of layers of nodes, or artificial neurons—an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each node connects to others, and has its own associated weight and threshold. If the output of any individual node is above the specified threshold value, that node is activated, sending data to the next layer of the network. Otherwise, no data is passed along to the next layer of the network.
Neural networks rely on training data to learn and improve their accuracy over time. Once they are fine-tuned for accuracy, they are powerful tools in computer science and artificial intelligence, allowing us to classify and cluster data at a high velocity. Tasks in speech recognition or image recognition can take minutes versus hours when compared to the manual identification by human experts. One of the best-known examples of a neural network is Google’s search algorithm.

Neural networks are sometimes called artificial neural networks (ANNs) or simulated neural networks (SNNs). They are a subset of machine learning, and at the heart of deep learning models.



assistant: 1. True or False: A neural network is a machine learning program that mimics the decision-making process of the human brain.
2. True or False: Every neural network consists of only an input layer and an output layer.
3. True or False: Each node in a neural network has its own associated weight and threshold.
4. True or False: If the output of a node is below the specified threshold value, that node is activated.
5. True or False: Neural networks do not need training data to learn and improve their accuracy.
6. True or False: Tasks in speech recognition or image recognition using neural networks can take hours compared to minutes when done manually by human experts.
7. True or False: Google’s search algorithm is an example of a neural network.
8. True or False: Neural networks are also known as artificial neural networks (ANNs) or simulated neural networks (SNNs).
